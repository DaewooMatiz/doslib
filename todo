TODO LIST FOR HACKIPEDIA CODE:

Take code out of 16-bit and 32-bit subdirectories and merge into other directories, adding the newer
makefile system as used in the "hw" subdir. The makefiles I stuck there pre-date their development
and are very inflexible. If you can have ONE source tree for libfaad, nettle, etc. that makes 16-bit
and 32-bit, then you can clean up a lot in here.

Bring the comdos, dos86, etc. *.mak stock files down to the top of the tree, where everyone can use
them.

Rewrite make scripts so that you can enable or disable building 286, 486, 586, 686, etc. specific
builds. These were disabled initially because it would take way too long to build every little
variation. Also add an option to reenable building "debug" builds.
