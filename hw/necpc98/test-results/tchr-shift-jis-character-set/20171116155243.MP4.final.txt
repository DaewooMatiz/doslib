Run on a PC-9821 laptop.

Captured on a Startech PEXHDCAP which surprisingly locked right onto the mode (when it normally has problems with IBM PC/AT VGA 400-line modes?)

An Av.io USB capture card on the other hand didn't like it and refused to capture it.

Video mode coming from the analog RGB connector was 640x400 56Hz with 24KHz horizontal refresh.

In this GIF I run the TATTR.EXE program to show how display attributes are handled.

Then, I run TCHR.EXE to run through what is shown on the screen for all 65536 possible character code values.

Note that during the run both cells are filled, whether fullwidth or not, to show whether it is rendered
half or full width. The first run, I use 'f' to toggle between filling in the second cell or not.
