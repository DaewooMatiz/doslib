Creative Sound Blaster 16 PnP:

- The maximum sample rate is 45454Hz. This maximum is enforced whether you use DSP 1.x/2.x/3.x
  or Sound Blaster 16 DSP playback commands.

- The minimum sample rate seems to vary, depending on which command set you use to play audio.

  Sound Blaster 1.x/2.x/3.x DSP playback:       3906Hz
  Sound Blaster 16 DSP playback:                4800Hz

- Sound Blaster 16 DSP playback appears to have a minor bug where you can use a sample rate
  as low as 4800Hz, but if you specify a rate below 4800Hz it clamps the rate to 4982Hz.

  unsigned int sb16dsp_play_rate(unsigned int desired) {
    if (desired > 45454)
      return 45454;
    else if (desired >= 4800)
      return desired;
    else
      return 4982;
  }

- The command set would have you think the card can support a wide range of sample rates
  from minimum to maximum. Actual hardware appears to round the sample rate to the nearest
  multiple of some unknown constant. This rounding affects both DSP 1.x/2.x/3.x and
  Sound Blaster 16 DSP commands.
