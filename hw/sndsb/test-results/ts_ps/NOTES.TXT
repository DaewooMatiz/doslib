Creative Sound Blaster 16 PnP:

- The maximum sample rate is 45454Hz. This maximum is enforced whether you use DSP 1.x/2.x/3.x
  or Sound Blaster 16 DSP playback commands.

- The minimum sample rate seems to vary, depending on which command set you use to play audio.

  Sound Blaster 1.x/2.x/3.x DSP playback:       3906Hz
  Sound Blaster 16 DSP playback:                4800Hz

- Sound Blaster 16 DSP playback appears to have a minor bug where you can use a sample rate
  as low as 4800Hz, but if you specify a rate below 4800Hz it clamps the rate to 4982Hz.

  unsigned int sb16dsp_play_rate(unsigned int desired) {
    if (desired > 45454)
      return 45454;
    else if (desired >= 4800)
      return desired;
    else
      return 4982;
  }

- The command set would have you think the card can support a wide range of sample rates
  from minimum to maximum. Actual hardware appears to round the sample rate to the nearest
  multiple of some unknown constant. This rounding affects both DSP 1.x/2.x/3.x and
  Sound Blaster 16 DSP commands.

  A quick guess from looking at the results is that the rate is rounded down to a multiple
  of (about, guessing) 192 plus some offset.

Reveal SC-400:

- The maximum sample rate depends on the command set used:

  - Sound Blaster 1.x/2.x non-highspeed:        23000Hz
  - Sound Blaster 2.x/3.x highspeed:            44100Hz
  - Sound Blaster 16:                           44000Hz

- The minimum sample rate depends on the command set used:

  - Sound Blaster 1.x/2.x/3.x:                  3800Hz
  - Sound Blaster 16:                           5300Hz

- The sample rate in Sound Blaster 1.x/2.x/3.x command set is rounded down a bit.
  Some time constants are handled at the same rate as the next one, except every so often.

- Sound Blaster 16 sample rate handling is EXTREMELY quanitized.
  The rate you set is rounded to one of the following:

    5300Hz
    6400Hz
    10800Hz
    18700Hz
    22000Hz
    33000Hz
    37600Hz
    44000Hz

- There are some odd discontinuities regarding SB 1.x/2.x/3.x commands.

  - Non-highspeed commands map sample rates from 3800Hz to 23000Hz as expected,
    but for some reason it then jumps to 25500Hz, then jumps to 23000Hz.

  - Highspeed commands map sample rates from 3800Hz to 37000Hz, but then the
    rate jumps to 44100Hz afterwards.
