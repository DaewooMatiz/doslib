- ADPCM playback notes

  ADPCM playback on the ESS seems to be far more capable than actual Creative
  hardware. Playback sounds the same as if SB16 hardware. No issues.

  4-bit ADPCM:                          Maximum 43478Hz
  2.6-bit ADPCM:                        Maximum 43478Hz
  2-bit ADPCM:                          Maximum 43478Hz
