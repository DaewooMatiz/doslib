- ADPCM playback notes

  Each ADPCM format maxes out at just under a specific limit.
  If you attempt to play at the limit or faster, the decoded audio exhibits
  jitter/artifact noise as if the DSP has signalled an output rate faster than
  it decode.

  4-bit ADPCM:                          Maximum just under 20KHz
  2.6-bit ADPCM:                        Maximum just under 20KHz
  2-bit ADPCM:                          Maximum just under 20KHz

- PAS IRQ vs SB IRQ

  INSTALL.EXE when configuring the card will give you the impression that the
  MV101 chip and the Sound Blaster compatible part can have different IRQs.

  Unfortunately that doesn't seem to work.

  Sound Blaster emulation appears to use the PAS IRQ anyway.

  Setting the PAS IRQ to 10 and the SB IRQ to 5 for example means that none
  of your DOS games will get a working interrupt.

  Setting the PAS IRQ to 3 and the SB IRQ to 5 will mean your DOS games
  detect a Sound Blaster on IRQ 3.

  The only way to get Sound Blaster emulation to work correctly is to set
  both IRQs to the same value.

  You *can* however set the PAS and SB emulation to use different DMA channels.

- No filtering.

  Much like the Sound Blaster it emulates, the Sound Blaster DAC does not filter
  it's output. Low sample rates sound "metallic" for that reason.
