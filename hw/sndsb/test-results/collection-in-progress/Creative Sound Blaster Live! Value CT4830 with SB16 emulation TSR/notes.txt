- Sample rate limits

  There are none. The card will take almost the entire TC range regardless
  whether you use non-highspeed or highspeed commands. If you use SB16
  commands, you can generally set any sample rate from 5Hz up to 65535Hz.

  There IS however a known issue where if you use highspeed commands and
  a time constant beyond about 0xFC, the emulated DSP will "hang" until
  you restart the test program.

- Direct DAC playback

  The emulated DSP will accept direct DAC commands but no sound will be
  generated by the card or TSR. Direct DAC playback is silent on the
  SB Live! cards.

- ADPCM playback notes

  ADPCM playback doesn't work. No DMA occurs. Live! cards do not emulate
  the ADPCM playback commands.
