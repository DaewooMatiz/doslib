DOSLIB provides three tools to play with the FONT RAM
on your EGA/VGA hardware.

NOTICE: Changes are temporary in nature. They will be
        lost when your BIOS is called to reset the
        video mode.

These three programs are:

FONTLOAD.EXE <file>         Load a binary file into VGA FONT RAM

FONTSAVE.EXE <file>         Save VGA FONT RAM to a binary file

FONTEDIT.EXE                Edit the VGA FONT RAM


FONTLOAD and FONTSAVE need to be given a filename.


FONTEDIT allows you to do live realtime editing of the VGA
FONT RAM.

FONTEDIT interface keys:

    ESC         Exit to DOS

    e           Use unshifted 'e' to switch between 'alpha' and 'font bitmap'
                editing mode.

    Space bar   Write character to screen in alpha mode, or
                toggle pixel in font bitmap mode

    + or =      Increment character value (in lower left corner)

    - or _      Decrement character value (in lower left corner)

    Arrow keys  Move editing cursor


FONTEDIT has two modes, 'alpha' and 'font bitmap' mode.

Alpha mode allows you to draw alphanumeric characters on the screen using the
arrow keys and the spacebar. The purpose of this mode is to allow placement
of characters to aid in editing VGA FONT RAM.

Font bitmap mode allows editing the font bitmap of the currently selected
character. Arrow keys control the scan line row and pixel to edit. Space bar
toggles the pixel. All changes happen realtime. Changes to the font bitmap
will be immediately visible on your DOS console wherever that character
appears.

The current selected character is always visible on the lower left hand
corner of the screen.



Example fonts.


Some example fonts are provided for you to get started and to see results
immediately. These *.VGA files can be loaded into your font RAM immediately
using FONTLOAD.EXE.

lamegthc.vga            A quick and dirty attempt at a "gothic" font.
                        Only A-Z and 0-9 have been changed.



BUGS TO FIX:

- FONTEDIT assumes your screen is in 80x25 text mode
- FONTEDIT does not read console screen size from BIOS or DOS
- FONTEDIT does not check whether the video mode is
  graphics or text.

Other consideration:
- This code has only been tested on VGA hardware.
  It *should* work on EGA, but I have no EGA hardware to test.
