Test framework.

These programs are used to test the behavior of hardware.
They are meant to run in either DOSBox-X or on real hardware.
They log to a TXT file in the current working directory when run.
These are meant to inform on the behavior of actual hardware,
and to help validate the accuracy of DOSBox-X emulation.
