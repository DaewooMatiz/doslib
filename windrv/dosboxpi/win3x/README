DOSBox-X mouse pointer integration driver for Microsoft Windows 3.1

When active, it uses the DOSBox-X integration device to read the absolute
cursor position of the user's cursor in the DOSBox-X emulator window, and
maps it to make Windows 3.1 match cursor position. In this way, this
driver provides the DOSBox-X equivalent of VirtualBox's Guest Additions
and the mouse pointer integration to allow interaction without having
to capture the mouse cursor.

How to manually install:

Take the compiled MOUSE.DRV file and copy it to a location on your hard
drive to "install" it.

Then edit C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI.

Locate the [boot] section, then the line:

mouse=mouse.drv

Change it to:

mouse=<location of the DOSBox-X mouse.drv file>

For example, if you copied it to \DOSBOX\MOUSE.DRV it would become:

mouse=C:\DOSBOX\MOUSE.DRV

When you start Windows 3.1, moving the cursor over the DOSBox-X window
should cause the cursor in Windows 3.1 to follow along. While the driver
is active, clicking the mouse buttons will directly interact with
Windows 3.1 without triggering the normal DOSBox-X "click to capture"
behavior.
