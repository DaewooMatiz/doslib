DOSBox-X mouse pointer integration driver for Microsoft Windows 3.1

When active, it uses the DOSBox-X integration device to read the absolute
cursor position of the user's cursor in the DOSBox-X emulator window, and
maps it to make Windows 3.1 match cursor position. In this way, this
driver provides the DOSBox-X equivalent of VirtualBox's Guest Additions
and the mouse pointer integration to allow interaction without having
to capture the mouse cursor.
