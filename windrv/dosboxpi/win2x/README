DOSBox mouse pointer integration driver for Windows 2.0.

To install, run the Windows setup utility, and reenter all
your settings. When you get to the mouse settings, select
"Other" and type in the full path of the DBOXMPI driver
install files (the DRV file and OEMSETUP.INF). Then
complete setup.

When you start Windows 2.x, the mouse cursor should
interact with DOSBox-X as expected.
