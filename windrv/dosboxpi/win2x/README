Attempted Windows 2.x compatible driver.

Noted:
 - Windows 3.0 real mode will load the driver,
   but will not load the driver if booting into
   standard (286) or enhanced (386) mode.

   I'm guessing Microsoft wisely built Windows 3.0
   to reject older drivers if not starting up
   in real mode.

 - Windows 2.x at this time refuses to install
   the driver (SETUP refuses it). I still think
   it has something to do with the NE CRC field.
