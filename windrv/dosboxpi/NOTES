Notes for future ports of this driver to Windows 2.x and Windows 1.x:

 - Looking at the Windows 1.x and 2.x MOUSE.DRV file, the interface (DLL entry points
   and structures) are the exact same as the one in Windows 3.x.

 - MouseGetIntVect() first appeared in Windows 2.x. That entry point does not exist
   in the Windows 1.x MOUSE.DRV file.

 - Windows 2.x and earlier require drivers and DLLs to have a valid 32-bit CRC in the
   NE header. Neither Windows nor the SETUP program will accept a DRV file with an
   invalid or zero CRC. Unfortunately, Open Watcom does not fill in the CRC field,
   nor can I find documentation on what exactly the algorithm they used.

 - NE headers in Windows 1.x and 2.x appear to set application type to 0, but
   other fields are valid. NE fields at byte offset 0x37 to 0x3F are zeroed out.

 - Windows 1.x and Windows 2.x require SETUP to change configuration because all
   kernel components are lumped into two large files by the SETUP program. For
   Windows 1.x, these files are WIN100.BIN and WIN100.OVL. For Windows 2.x, these
   files are WIN200.BIN and WIN200.OVL. All device drivers selected in the SETUP
   program are copied into these two files and loaded into memory at runtime.
   There is no SYSTEM.INI to add or replace drivers.

 - However... the Windows 2.x SETUP program does support the OEMSETUP.INF scheme
   where 3rd party drivers can be installed from disk. You can take a Windows 3.0
   OEMSETUP, remove the VXD fields, and then give it to Windows 2.0 SETUP and it
   will see the device driver listed in the OEMSETUP.INF.

 - Windows 2.x SETUP gets it's list of drivers from SETUP.INF, which is written
   in a syntax that is very different from later versions of Windows. One could
   add "DOSBox-X Mouse Pointer Integration" to SETUP.INF if one wanted a DOSBox-X
   based Windows 2.x install set.

 - You can give Windows 1.x PS/2 mouse support by copying MOUSE.DRV from Windows 2.x
   and then overwriting MOUSE.DRV on Windows 1.x install disks with it. Run the
   SETUP program again, select "Microsoft Mouse (bus or serial)" and that driver
   will be packed into WIN100.BIN. When you run Windows 1.0, the newer driver will
   detect the PS/2 mouse and feed mouse events to Windows as expected.

 - As far as I can tell, once I satisfy the requirements imposed by Windows 2.x
   and Windows 1.x, I could theoretically get DOSBox pointer integration working
   with Windows 2.x and Windows 1.x.

   - I could make an OEMSETUP.INF disk for Windows 2.x, then let SETUP take my
     driver and pack it into WIN200.OVL and WIN200.BIN.

   - Getting it to work with Windows 1.x would require overwriting MOUSE.DRV and
     then rerunning SETUP to re-pack drivers and kernel files into WIN100.BIN
     and WIN100.OVL.

 - Question: at what point did absolute pointer support appear in the mouse
   interface? When did SF_ABSOLUTE appear in the DDK? I'm concerned that going
   back far enough the absolute coordinates returned by the driver will probably
   not be interpreted as absolute coordinates and the mouse cursor will probably
   not act as expected given DOSBox-X's interaction with the driver.
