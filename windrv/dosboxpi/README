Windows device drivers for DOSBox-X pointer integration.

This device driver comes in as a mouse to Windows, and uses
the DOSBox integration device to read the absolute position
of the user's cursor within the emulator window. The idea is
that, much like VirtualBox Guest Additions, the user will
be able to click and interact with the guest Windows system
without having to capture the mouse within the emulator
window.

Some of the source code requires non-free software to compile.
Microsoft components such as these are required:

 - Microsoft MASM
 - Microsoft C++ 1.5 (16-bit compiler)
 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 DDK and Windows 3.1 SDK

Other drivers are able to compile using entirely open source
tools.
