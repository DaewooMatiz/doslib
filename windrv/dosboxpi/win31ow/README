This is an attempt to re-implement the Windows 3.1
mouse driver from scratch using NASM and Open Watcom.

I do not approve of the bizarre techniques used by
Microsoft in their SDK mouse sample source code.
The NE executable format allows segments and attributes
for each, I think there are better ways of defining
interrupts than hacking your data segment to be
fixed and copying your interrupt handler and state
into an alias like that.

Note that because of stringent arrangement requirements
for Windows drivers, other library code is duplicated
here.
