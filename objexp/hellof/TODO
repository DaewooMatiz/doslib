* Need to find a way for the data and code to be merged together such that
  data is accessible from CS, and the init code and data are merged together
  as near pointers.

  I propose: Something to take OMF OBJs and merge them into one big OBJ where
  everything is stuffed into a code segment, but in a manner we control. Then
  we feed the big OBJ to the linker.

  (better yet, if we were to write our own linker to make a .COM image or
   what we need!)
