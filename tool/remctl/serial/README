Remote debugging tool, for MS-DOS, via null modem RS-232 cable.

The client is the Windows/Linux program talking to the DOS system.

The server is the utility or TSR running on the DOS system.

The client is written to talk with the server either through a
RS-232 null modem cable or through a localhost telnet connection
opened by a running DOSBox instance (serial1=nullmodem).

NOTE: You need to specify "serial1=nullmodem transparent:1" in dosbox.conf
      to disable handshaking.
