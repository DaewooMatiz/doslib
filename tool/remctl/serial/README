Remote debugging tool, for MS-DOS, via null modem RS-232 cable.

The client is the Windows/Linux program talking to the DOS system.

The server is the utility or TSR running on the DOS system.

The client is written to talk with the server either through a
RS-232 null modem cable or through a localhost telnet connection
opened by a running DOSBox instance (serial1=nullmodem).

NOTE: You need to specify "serial1=nullmodem transparent:1" in dosbox.conf
      to disable handshaking.

To use with a null-modem cable, install the REMSVR.EXE program (preferably
the dos86s version) on the target DOS machine, connect the null-modem cable
to the primary serial port (ideally, COM1), and then connect the other end
to your Linux / Windows system.

If your Linux / Windows system has serial ports on the motherboard, they
will appear in Linux's /dev directory as /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, etc.
If you are using a USB to serial adapter, then the USB-serial adapter
will show up in /dev as /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc.

CAUTION: This program uses some internal state of MS-DOS to listen to
         the serial port and enable background filesystem I/O. Due to
         the non-reentrant nature of MS-DOS, filesystem corruption
         or system instability may occur in extreme cases where this
         program is not able to handle background I/O vs MS-DOS
         reentrancy. The theoretical risk increases with the use of
         disk caching and disk compression drivers. It is recommended
         not to use this program on any system where filesystem or
         system corruption would be damaging, use only on systems
         that are "disposable" i.e. the DOS system can be reloaded in
         the event that such corruption occurs.

         Use at your own risk.
