Remote debugging tool, for MS-DOS, via null modem RS-232 cable.

The client is the Windows/Linux program talking to the DOS system.

The server is the utility or TSR running on the DOS system.

The client is written to talk with the server either through a
RS-232 null modem cable or through a localhost telnet connection
opened by a running DOSBox instance (serial1=nullmodem).

NOTE: You need to specify "serial1=nullmodem transparent:1" in dosbox.conf
      to disable handshaking.

To use with a null-modem cable, install the REMSVR.EXE program (preferably
the dos86s version) on the target DOS machine, connect the null-modem cable
to the primary serial port (ideally, COM1), and then connect the other end
to your Linux / Windows system.

If your Linux / Windows system has serial ports on the motherboard, they
will appear in Linux's /dev directory as /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, etc.
If you are using a USB to serial adapter, then the USB-serial adapter
will show up in /dev as /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc.
